Today, after a brief introduction by Prof. Conrad, each lecture section broke into 30 minute Zoom breakout sessions:

* The 3:30pm lecture broke into breakout sessions for
  * the noon discussion section (led by Scott)
  * the 1pm discussion section (led by Andrew and Cole)
* The 5pm lecture broke into breakout sessions for the 2pm and 3pm discussion sections
  * the 2pm discussion section (led by Scott)
  * the 3pm discussion section (led by Bryan and Kristin)

Prof. Conrad alternated between the two sessions. 

During the sessions, the leaders went over the eight project selections for each of discussion sections.
* These eight projects were chosen from among those submitted during the 03/31 lecture by students from the respective discussion section.   
* The choices were made by the course staff based on the peer ratings of the students in the course, as well as the judgement of the staff about which projects were most feasible.
* A list of those choices can be found here:
  * [CS48 S20 Project Choices by Section](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16KOfY7M2nEXVJQRhX0eHqjbhs2e9dKYQdY7cbwGvlhg/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Note that there is a tab at the botton of the sheet for each section.
  
Students were then asked to complete a survey (with separate survey instances for each discussion section) in which they were asked:

* First name, last name, perm, email, pronouns
* To rank order the eight project choices
* Level of proficiency with Java and JavaScript
* Prior experience with CS56
* Attitude towards Java Spring Boot Tech Stack, and JavaScript Next.js tech stacks.
   * Scale: 0-definitely not, 1-prefer not, 2-sure no problem, 3-oh heck yes!
* Preferred times of day to work
* Due date for survey: 5pm Friday 04/03/2020 

The rest of the time was spent discussing the general outline of how the course will proceed:

We discussed that Agile is based on the idea of "inspect and adapt", both for:
* **what**:the product you are building (short iteration cycles, lots of feedback from users)
* **how**: the process by which you are building it (iterations/sprints with retrospectives.)

We did not discuss all of the items below in detail, but we mentioned some of them, and will go into more detail
in the weeks ahead.

* Forming teams
* Establishing team norms/procedures 
* Defining user stories / issues
* Defining a minimum viable product
* Setting up a Kanban board
* Assigning user stories to individuals for an iteration
* Completing issues, and doing pull requests
* Code reviews
* Retrospectives

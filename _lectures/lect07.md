# Today

Brief discussion of team leadership roles
- Leading a team MVP, story grooming discussion
- Leading a Retro 
- Giving a class presentation
- etc.

Brief discussion of retros
- Choose *today* who will lead your first retro
- So, let's discsus just enough so that you know what you are committing to
- <https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/topics/retros/>

# Team Activity #1 in `team/LEADERSHIP.md`

Your project repo has a name of the form `project-s0-t1-name`.

It will show up if you are logged into GitHub, and use this search:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-s20?q=project->

In your project repo, in file `team/LEADERSHIP.md`
- record who led the team discussion for Monday 04/13 (yesterday)
- record who will lead today's team discussion
- record who will lead the full first team retro (Monday)

You can use a Markdown table to make this easy to read.  It's fine to just record this directly on the `master` branch, editing directly in the GitHub web interface.

Example:

```
# Leadership roles

| Date      | Name              | Activity                                               |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Mon 04/13 | Chris Gaucho      | Led team discussion to define MVP, acceptance criteria | 
| Tue 04/14 | Lauren del Playa  | Led team discussion of learning plan                   | 
| Mon 04/20 | Taylor Chen       | Will lead first Retro                                  | 

```

# Team Activity #2 in `team/LEARNING.md`

* Discussion of learning your stack
  - You should not be relying on us to "teach you" next.js or Spring Boot
  - In your team, discuss: current level of familiarity with team's chosen tech stack
  - Discuss: how you as a team will learn the necessary skills
* Record in `team/LEARNING.md` a plan for learning the skills
  
# More on the learning plan

The format of the learning plan is up to the team, as long as it includes the following:

* An brief assessment of the team's existing strengths
  - Are there folks on your team that already have skills in one more important areas?
  - Can these folks help to onboard and train some of the other team members?
  - Can you "stategically pair"
* An brief assessment of areas where the team needs to develop it's knowledge
  - What are the most signficant gaps in your team's knowledge?
* A plan that includes specific committments by each team member (by name) as to what they will do over the next 
  week (week 3) and the following week (week 4) to improve their skills

The plan could include things like:

* John commits to working through a tutorial on basic HTML/CSS during week 3, and a tutorial on React and React-Bootstrap during week 4.
* Susan commits to working through a tutorial on MongoDB during week 3, and learning how to work with MongoDB in a Next.js app during week 4.
* Alice and Bob will pair together during the MVP iteration, since Alice has more experience with the tech stack.  Alice and
  Bob will use strong-style pairing with Bob at the keyboard as much as possible, until Bob feels confident. 
  
# A *Partial* List of important technologies, by Stack

You might use this list to come up with ideas for your `/team/LEARNING.md` file.

Note that:
* This list is not necessarily complete. It's just a "good start".
* The tutorials linked to are just a starting point.   They aren't the only, or necessarily even the "best" tutorials---just the first ones that seemed reasonable to link to.
* As you find better resources, you are *strongly encouraged* to share those on the `_articles` channels on the Slack.

# If you have extra time

* MVP kanban board column (if not *fully* done)
  - If the Kanban board column for your MVP is not complete (i.e all stories groomed with clear acceptance criteria), work on that.   
  - This should be finished by Thursday if possible, next Monday midnight *at the latest* so your team is ready to start working a week from today.
* Finish anything you were "in the middle of" when time ran out yesterday.
* If that's done, choose either:
  - Get started on the learning plan
  - Futher definition on iterations beyond MVP

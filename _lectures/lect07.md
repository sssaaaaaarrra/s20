## Topics: 

* Announcements: Project Deliverable Grading Component:
 
   Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the TAs and I plan to use for the "Final Product" 35% of the course grade. 

   	* 15% Presentation
   	*  5% Idea, and Idea Refinement
   	* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish)
   	* 15% Technical Difficulty Implemented
   	* 20% Implementation
   	* 10% Design Process
   	* 10% Manual

   We will cross-reference against both an initial quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators, and against a ranking stemming from peer-review
 

   Submit final project materials and documentation:
   * Complete code for your project. You can use any publicly available libraries / code / artwork / materials as long as you correctly acknowledge all sources.
   * Manual for your product. Document that describes how the product is to be used. Please make use of screen shots here to document all functionality.
   * Documentation of your programming effort and your design process. This should be a separate document, giving an overview of the different steps you went through and presenting all documentation materials you produced on the way. This may include:
	  * All external resources you used / consulted for your project. Documentation of the different stages of your design (see above, with additional material, e.g. sketches, mockups, questionnaires, etc.)
	  * Evaluation/Testing results (qualitative, quantitative). There should be a description on when and how testing took place, and a presentation of the results. 
	  * A summary of your design decisions and what they were based on.
	  * Any implementation difficulties you encountered and how you addressed them.

   Project Presentation:
   Every group has 10 minutes plus Q&A.

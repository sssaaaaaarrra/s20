Please open a web browser tab to one of these:
* [H06-3:30pm on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/116662/assignments/494719/submissions) (for 3:30pm section)
* [H06-5pm on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/116662/assignments/494720/submissions) (for 5pm section)

Please follow along.   Choose the appropriate radio button for each team as they present, and fill in *at least* a brief description of what the product, service or game is that their MVP offers.

At the end you'll be asked to choose which four of the eight presentations are the "top four".   So make notes as needed as you go along.

I'll roll an eight sided die to determine the order.

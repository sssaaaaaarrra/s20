* Reminder: No class on Wednesday. Come to the [UCSB CS Summit, summit.cs](http://www.ucsb-cs-summit.com/)! 

* Reminder: First three project presentations on Thursday during Section: **4pm-Tree**, **4pm-Laptops**, and **5pm-Rideshare**

* Reminder: Project Deliverable Grading Component:
 
   Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the TAs and I plan to use for the "Final Product" 35% of the course grade. 
   * 15% Presentation
   *  5% Idea, and Idea Refinement
   * 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish)
   * 15% Technical Difficulty Implemented
   * 20% Implementation
   * 10% Design Process
   * 10% Manual  
<br/>

   We will cross-reference against both an initial quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators, and against a ranking stemming from peer-review
 
* **Complete code for your project**: This is obviously your GitHub Repo, which should be **frozen by Thu, March 12, 7pm*** modulo tutor-approved fixes. 

* **Submit final documentation by Tue, March 17, 23:59:59:**
   * Manual for your product. Document that describes how the product is to be used. Please make use of screen shots here to document all functionality.
   * Documentation of your programming effort and your design process. This should be a separate document, giving an overview of the different steps you went through and presenting all documentation materials you produced on the way. This may include:
	  * Acknowledgement of all external resources you used / consulted for your project. Documentation of the different stages of your design (see above, with additional material, e.g. sketches, mockups, questionnaires, etc.)
	  * Evaluation/Testing results (qualitative, quantitative). There should be a description on when and how testing took place, and a presentation of the results. 
	  * A summary of your design decisions and what they were based on.
	  * Any implementation difficulties you encountered and how you addressed them.  
<br/>

   Project Presentation:
   Every group has 15 minutes incl. Q&A.

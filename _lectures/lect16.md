* Discuss how HTTP works
  - Request / Response
  - GET/POST and idempotency

* Discuss *front-end* vs. *backend*
  - End point vs. API end points
  - Frontend: loading web pages you see in your browser.  You can test by just putting URL in the browser and seeing what comes up.
  - Backend: these are web request/response transactions that are hidden away: the browser talks to the server and exchanges JSON messages.  You can test those using `curl` or Postman (or dev tools of the browser) but you usually can't do it just by typing URLs into your web browser.

* Discuss React `pages` vs. Node `pages/api`

* Passing data within/among React components.

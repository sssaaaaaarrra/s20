As announced on Slack:
* Retro and Sprint Planning pushed forward one week
* MVP Demo still on for Thursday

Today:
* Standup
* Planning your Demo
* Use rest of time as team sees fit

# Planning your demo

* Plan a five minute presentation
* You may do it live, or you may prepare a 5 minute "unlisted" YouTube video
  - I'll make a YouTube video explaining how to make a video via Zoom and then upload it
    to YouTube, and then make it available to those with the link.
  - Links to videos may be made available to the class, but will not be made public
* Present to an audience of potential users
  - Not to an audience of CS48 students, or the instructor or TAs.
  - Explain what problem the app solves, or what need it fulfills, as you demo the features of
    the app.
* Stay focused on user functionality.
  - Do not go into details of implementation, or team process.
  - There will be other presentations for that.
* Optionally, you may introduce with a powerpoint slide, and/or close with one, but the bulk
  of the time, you should be sharing your screen and showing us your app.
* At the end, tell us a bit about upcoming features planned for the next iteration.
* There may be questions from instructor

You'll be asked to evaluate each presentation, so plan to watch each one and be ready to
do some very brief writing after each one.

# Other Announcements

Two videos about the project-idea-reviewer-nextjs app  announced on Slack channel:

* This video explains a bit about front-end/back-end and the `authenticatedAction` function: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MEW1trB1eQ>

* This video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpgmGwFzU34> explains a bit about `getServerSideProps` which is a special NextJS feature added on to React, and how it can be used to:
  - redirect the user to the login page if they are not logged in and need to be to access a certain page.
  - redirect the user to the home page if they don't have the proper role for a page they are trying to access.
  
  This is mainly useful when you have different user roles in your app (e.g. `admin` vs.
  regular users) or if/when you want to restrict certain features to, e.g., only users
  with `@ucsb.edu` email addresses.

If you have other questions about NextJS, React, MongoDB, etc. that you'd like us to make
videos about, let us know.

Even though this says "lecture", I'm going to use it for
notes on discussion sections and lecture alike.

# Announcements

* Sorry, no crashers: enrollment is final
* Must attend your actual enrolled discussion section
   * And work with folks enrolled in that section

# "Open Lab Hours"

* There is one TA, Scott Chow
* There are four LAs as of right now (there may be more later)

* LAs for noon/1pm, and 3:30 lecture
  * Andrew Lu, Cole Bergmann

* LAs for 2pm/3pm and 5pm lecture
  * Bryan Terce, Kristin Hu

We will have some kind of online office hours / open lab hours
where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out the details yet.  Stay tuned.
  

# Goals for today

* Get comfortable with Zoom
* Ask questions
* Meet some of your classmates

# Zoom practice

Everyone find:
* The participant list
* The raise hand / lower hand button
  * Practice with raising and lowering hand
* The zoom chat window
  * Through we'll more often use the section / lecture Slack channel
* The course website <http://ucsb-cs48.github.io>

# Breakout group practice

In your breakout groups:
* Unmute yourself
* Say your name, year
* Share "a rose and a thorn"
  * A rose: something positive that you are encouraged by,
    a source of happiness.
  * A thorn: something challenging that set you back,
    or that you will need to overcome.
* Practice sending up the signal that your group needs help.
  * Somewhere in the breakout room, there should be a place
    where you can indicate that the group needs help from a host.
  * See if you can find that and send up the signal.
* If extra time, discuss
  * Any thoughts about how to stay healthy and connected
  * Tips / tricks for getting through S20
* At some point, you'll get a signal that we are reconvening
  in the main room.

# A few more notes 

Below this line, these were not up during the noon session.

* There is a new product for accessing CSIL: Remote Desktop
  * Give it a try: <https://doc.engr.ucsb.edu/display/EPK/Remote+Access+to+Computer+Science+Computing+Labs>


# Reconvening: Q & A

This is an "ask me anything" session.

I may not have answers.  We are still figuring this all out in real time.

But I'll do my best.


# Tuesday and Thursday will be vital to group formation

Please be there!

# Today: Retrospective

* We'll put you in breakout groups.
* When you are finished, just leave.
  * No need to come back to main room, unless you have questions
* Staff will be dropping in to observe.

# Deliverable

* In `team/RETROS.md`, add this:

  ```
  # Retro 05/11/20

  * Led by: name-goes-here
  * Present: name1, name2, ... , nameN
  * Absent: name1, name2, ...

  ## Action item

  * a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  * a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
  * a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team acheive the goal, or move closer to it.

  ```

* After the Retro

  All Team members: Fill out survey (see Slack for link)
  
  Retro leader: add Section to `team/RETROS.md`
  
  ```
  ## Retro Assessment

  * A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
  * A brief assessment of how it went.
  * What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
    based on what you learned today?
  ```

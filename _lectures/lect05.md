  - Work in your teams on defining your MVP

# Homework for Monday Midnight 

* <https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/s20/hwk/h01/>
* It's an intro to Agile
* Note: on the "dates" question 
  - I am not usually one for memorizing dates
  - I'm making an exception in this case because it's important to know how long Agile has been around.
  - Many folks act as if it's either "brand new", or "has been around for ever"
  - The actual age of Agile is important to putting it into context

# What is important about Agile?

* **Inspect and Adapt**
  * This is the most important Agile principle
  * The idea is to be empirical, scientific, flexible
  * **Dogmatic** adherence to process is the **opposite** of true agile
* Inspect and Adapt what?
  * What/Why: The product we are building, based on user/customer feedback
  * How: The process by which we build it, based on periodic retrospectives

# Where do user stories fit in?

* They drive the process of development
* They keep the focus on what the user needs and why they need it
* In these projects: **you are your own user**
  * Note that it's a mantra of software development: **You are not your user**
  * In most real world settings, that literally true
  * That's one way this course differs from real world Agile
* Keep in mind what *hat* you are wearing
  * The user hat or the developer hat

# Pitfalls

* Suggesting features that would be "fun to build" 
* Suggesting features that would be "a good learning experience".
* Suggesting building a feature "just because you can"

All of those are fine for
* a "hackathon project" or a "side project"
* in the real world: "10% time", "Future Focused Friday", "Hack Day"

BUT: 
* It is NOT how you should suggest features for a *real* product
* Even though this is a university course and the main objective is learning...
* ... what we are trying to learn mostly is the *process* of developing *real* software.

Thus:

Learning the self-discipline of driving features from user needs, in *this* course, is *more* important than learning a paricular API, technology, etc.

# Minimum Viable Product

See: <https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/topics/minimum_viable_product/>


# Breakout work today

Two options:

# Option 1:

* A demonstration/lecture by Scott Chow about how to get started with next.js
* Link: <https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started/setup>

# Option 2:

* Add an MVP column to your Kanban board.

We'll put you all in breakout groups.

* In your group discuss whether you want to hear the next.js lecture/demo or work on your teams on your MVP.
* If you want to hear the next.js lecture, just return to the main group.
* Otherwise, work in your teams.
* If you have questions, click the "Ask for Help button".

# Sprint Goal

* Identify leader (in `team/LEADERSHIP.md`)
* Leader, ask a team member other than you to share the screen and, edit `team/STATUS.md`. 
  
  (It's best to have someone else do this so that the leader can facilitate discussion)
  
  Editor: add this at top:

  ```
  # Sprint Planning, 05/12/2020
  
  * Leader: name here
  * Present: names here (or just write "all")
  * Absent: names here (or just write "none")
  
  ```
* Leader: ask one of more of the 10 powerful questions from the article I shared before class:

  * <https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/10-powerful-questions-create-better-sprint-goals>

* Someone edit `team/STATUS.md` and add this:

  ```
  ## Sprint Goal for 05/12-05/21
  
  Which of the 10 powerful questions did you ask?
  
  Describe your sprint goal here.
  
  Describe briefly how you came up with that goal.
  
  ## Discussion of previous Sprint Goal
  
  Briefly: was the sprint goal acheived?  Was it too ambitious?  Too modest? 
  
  ```

  Then, as the leader facilitates the discussion, add in a summary of the discussion.
  
When you are done with identifying the sprint goal, move on to Sprint Planning

# Sprint Planning

This starts with a standup, but then goes deeper.

You should review the status of every column on the Kanban board and be sure that:
* *First* that the work in progress column is accurate.
  - Each team member is assigned to at least one issue
  - Each issue in the in-progress column has a complete list of acceptance criteria and a user story in "as an A I can B so that C" format.
* *Second* be sure there is a column for your next iteration/sprint and that the contents of that column are exactly the stories you want to try to accomplish for the next demo a week from Thursday.  
  - Each of the stories that isn't yet assigned should nevertheless have a user story and complete acceptance criteria.
* *Third*, check the rest of the board (in-review, done, icebox) etc. to be sure they are up to date.

This may take you more time than the rest of the meeting; if so, plan some time outside of class to try to complete this before Thursday if possible.

If you do get done, however, work together in pairs, as a mob, or as individuals on the stories in progress--or use the time in whatever way your team sees fit.

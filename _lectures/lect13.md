# NOTE: There may be more added to these notes later.

# Today

* Standup
* Review your Kanban board, and PRs
* Use the rest of the time as you see fit.


# Review Kanban board / PRS

One member of team share Kanban board on screen
* Go over the "In-Progress" column; does it reflect reality?
  - Ideally, each team member should be assigned to at least one in-progress issue
  - If you are working on an issue, be sure you are *assigned* to that issue.
  - If you are working on something for which there is no issue, consider creating an issue
  - If you are working in a pair or group, add pair partners to the issue
* Go over the "In Review" column.  In a second window, open PRs for repo
  - The open PRs and the issues in the "In Review" column should be aligned
  - If not, fix that.    Be sure that issues reference PRs and vice-versa
  - If there are PRs that need to be reviewed, assign reviewers.
  - Discuss that status of each PR
* If there are issues that should be dragged into the *done* column, put them there.

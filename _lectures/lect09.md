# lab00 update

* Extending ontime deadline for lab00 to Tuesday midnight
  * "late" (with no penalty) to Thursday midnight.
* The deadline is more for *you* than for us.
  * We are in no hurry to grade it.
  * BUT, you need these skills/capabilities to get started
  * And if there are problems, we need to debug as a class
* "Debug as a class" means that there are roles for
  - the individual
  - the team
  - the course staff (TA Scott, and LAs Andrew, Bryan, Cole, Kristin, Victor)
  - the instructor

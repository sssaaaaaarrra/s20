Today, if all goes well, we'll be using a webapp that was developed by your course staff.

* The app is one that will allow us to generate project idea, and then rate one another's ideas.
* It is intended to reproduce an exercise called [25:10](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/12-2510-crowd-sourcing/)
  that is the basis for how Prof. HÃ¶llerer and I have generated project idea for CMPSC 48 in W19 and W20.
  
However, that exercise requires face-to-face interation and is done with index cards, or pieces of paper.

We tried to build an app that could do that same exercise, but via a webapp.

# The project-idea-generator project team:

* me (Phill Conrad)
* Scott Chow (TA)
* Andrew Lu (LA)
* Cole Bergmann (LA)
* Bryan Terce (LA)
* Kristin Hu (LA)

It was a true team effort: each of us contributed.  
And we went through quite a few of the same steps you'll go through this quarter.

If all does *not* go well, you'll get to see how hard it is to actually deliver a 
working app.  

And we'll go to plan B

# What you'll do next


* We will paste a URL into the chat window of Zoom
  * There are separate links for each discussion section. 
  * Be sure you click on the right one (noon, 1pm, 2pm, or 3pm)
* Please open that app, and login with your UCSB email address (name@ucsb.edu).
* You should see that in the upper right hand corner, you have the role "student".
* If so, it's working!
* Then we'll go into breakout rooms to make it easier to help folks who are having trouble.

# If you have the student role

* **Enter a project idea**. You should see a form where you can enter a project idea. 
  * You have 10 minutes.  Come up with the best project idea you can in 10 minutes.
  * If you can't come up with a good project idea, put in a mediocre project idea.
  * Don't stress over this too much.  We are grading this on participation, and doing your best, not on 
    the quality of your idea.
  * Nevertheless, come up with the best idea you can!
* **Rate other project (at least five)**.
  * Once you've put in a project idea, you'll be able to rate other students project ideas (anonymously).
  * Rate at least five, but after that you can rate more if you like.
  * Don't spend too long on each rating.  You have about 10 minutes to rate five project ideas.

After about 20 minutes, or after we see that everyone is done, we'll reconvene in the main group.

The staff will take the highest rated ideas, and select eight from each group (by discussion section).

Then you'll get to indicate your project preferences.  This is how we'll form groups.

We will also ask you again about your tech stack preferences (in case you've changed your mind.)


# Plan B (and what we'll do if we have extra time)

# MVP Planning

To help your team (as well as your instructional staff) know what you are defining as part of your MVP---which you are delivering two weeks from Thursday (02/13)
, we are asking you to do things process/tool wise:

* Create a new column on your Kanban board.  
   * Call it MVP, and put everything (in terms of user stories and issues) from the TODO column that is part of MVP into that column.
   * Leave everything that is NOT part of MVP in the TODO column.
   
In addition, issues on Github can have tags.  Github creates some predefined tags, but can edit these and add new ones.

* Add a new tag called MVP.
   * Add that tag to all of the issues that are in the MVP column, as well as any issues that are already in-progress or done
      that are part of your MVP.
 
Finally, while regular cards cannot be given "tags" in the same way that issues are, you can just use the letters `(MVP)` in parens
as a kind of tag on the user stories that are part of your MVP.

In this way, anyone can look at your Kanban board, and see:
* What is, and what is not part of your MVP
* Which user stories and issues are still not started, in progress, or done, with respect to your MVP.


You main task in the remaining sprint is to adjust the user stories and issues that you want to include in the MVP.

There will be more detail on how to do that in Section.

# Choose the right size MVP!

* If it doesn't deliver value ⇒ too small
* If you can't finish by due date ⇒ too big

Today: 

* (15-45 minutes) An overview of next.js (Bryan)
  - Spring Boot Team: optional for you.  
* Rest of the time (at least 30 minutes) Work in your teams.

I'll put you in breakout rooms, and then everyone except the Spring Boot team just leave the breakout room immediately and return to the main room.

# lab00 deadline

Look, don't sweat the deadline.  Just make sure that you get started asap.

* The point of the deadline is that you need to be ready to help your team
* That means you need to learn the tech stack.
* We'll be chill about the deadline as long as you are sincerely making an attempt.

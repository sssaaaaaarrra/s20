# public vs. private?

- Be sure to audit for `.env, secrets-localhost.properties, secrets-heroku.properties`
- Be sure to audit for secrets embedded in your code (e.g. from tutorials from other sources)
- If you have any of these, even on older commits or other branches, do NOT make repo public unless/until you invalidate old secrets.

# opting in to "limited" sharing within the class

If you are willing to allows us to give other class teams "read only" access to your code, pleae let us know.

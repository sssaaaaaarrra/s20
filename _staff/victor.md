  Victor Sanchez Gutierrez (he/him/his) is a senior standing UCSB student pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 
  He enjoys teaching and helping people reach that "Ohhhhh!" 
  moment they get when they finally figure out a tough concept. Victor knows a handful of 
  languages like Java, Python, C/C++, Ocaml, and Scheme/Lisp. He enjoys participating in hackathons and learning about new technology.
  Feel free to ask about any CS classes he's taken that you might be interested in knowing more.
  Outside of CS and school life Victor enjoys hanging out with people and making new friends. If he wasn't a CS major, 
  he would pursue a culinary career because food is life. Playing video games is also an activity he does quite often.
  He has a PS1, PS2, 
  Xbox One, Switch, and a gaming PC and yet dispite all the choices he really only play like 4 or 5 different games. 
  When he has the chance, Victor would love to travel to Japan and Mexico!

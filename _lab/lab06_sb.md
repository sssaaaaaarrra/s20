This is an alternative to [lab06](https://ucsb-cs48.github.io/s20/lab/lab06/) for teams that are not using React.

This lab is for teams using the Spring Boot web framework, and focuses on introducing tools for linting source code.

Example Tools include:
* [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) - a tool for checking code formatting style rules 
* [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) - a tool for automatically reformatting code to comply with style rules
* [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) - a tool to check whether certain architectural principles are being followed
* [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/latest/) - a static code analyzer that looks for many code anti-patterns

TODO: Insert detailed instructions

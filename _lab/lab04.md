# Recording your team's retro artifact

It might be convenient to store the team's retrospective artifacts in one of our existing places (e.g. under the team directory of the repo, or on the team repo's wiki).

However, there is a sense in which a team's retrospective artifacts should really be private to the team itself.  

It will also help the instructional staff to have a consistent naming convention so that we can locate your retro artifacts for course grading purposes.

## Create private `team-name_RETROS` repo

Accordingly, the team should please create a **private* repo with the name as indicated below.  
* The retro leader should take responsibility for making sure this happens, but...
* It is totally appropriate to delegate the actual creation to another member of the team 
* It is helpful if this happens *before* the class meeting where the retro is scheduled.

First thing: go to <https://github.com/{{page.github_org}}> and create a new **private* repo with your teams name followed by the suffix `_RETROS`

| For team | create repo | with link    |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `4pm-stock-trading` | `4pm-stock-trading_RETROS` | [4pm-stock-trading_RETROS](https://github.com/{{page.github_org}}/4pm-stock-trading_RETROS) |
| `5pm-pet-life` | `5pm-pet-life_RETROS` | [5pm-pet-life_RETROS](https://github.com/{{page.github_org}}/5pm-pet-life_RETROS) |

etc...

Create it as follows:
* private
* with a `README.md`
* no `.gitignore` and no `LICENSE`  needed

Then, add each of the team members to that repo as collaborators, by their github id, as `admin` level collaborators.

It is not necessary to add your mentor, TA or instructor&mdash;we have access automatically since the repo is created under the github `{{page.github_org}}` organization.

# Recording the artifact

Make a file called `retro1.md` in the repo.

## Required

In the file:
* Record who led the retro
* Record the list of which team members participated in the retro
* Record the *EXPERIMENT* that your team will undertake as a result of this retro
   * Something your team will do differently
   * What result you hope to get 
   * How you will measure whether you got that result

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

# The deadline for {{page.num}}, i.e. {{page.due}} is the final deadline for software dev

By this deadline, you should have reviewed and accepted your final pull request of the quarter for any new development.   

After this deadline, you 
* should NOT be adding or turning on new features
* should NOT be doing major refactorings

Permitted, with mentor approval: a **reasonable** number of:
* Small bug fixes (bugs that went unnoticed until final demoing)
* Minor fixes to style issues

The changes should be ones that are easy to review and understand, and each should be in its own separate pull request.

# About this deadline

The context of the deadline is that the mentors and TAs reviewing your work ARE ALSO STUDENTS and have their own school work, final exams, etc.  

The spirit of the rule allowing minor changes is that the changes here would be considered "patch updates", not items that would constituted a major or minor new release of the software, and are relatively easy for a mentor/TA to review and accept if they have already reviewed your main project code.

# What to do in lab on {{page.lab_date}}

You will be working toward your mentor being able to make a final assessment of your project.

Mentors, please copy the rubric from the template:

[lab08_rubric.md](https://github.com/ucsb-cs48-w20/cs48_agile/blob/master/lab08_rubric.md)

Copy this into the team's private `_FEEDBACK` repo and fill in each item.

Do this with the team watching.

# Are these assessments final?

MENTORS: At your discretion:
* over the coming week until the deadline on 03/12, work with the team and find a way to sign off on the items in the rubric. 
* TEAMS: BE SURE provided that you leave yourself enough time to complete the re-review BEFORE lab09's lab STARTS (*NOT* during next week's lab).

After next week's lab, the TAs and instructor will assign final grades for lab08.

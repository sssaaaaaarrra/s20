As before, the web page <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/> can be consulted as a reference for topics
having to do with Agile.

In this homework, we'll review the *manifesto* and focus on the *12 principles* 




<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li style="margin-bottom:0em;" markdown="1">  The Agile Manifesto states that the signatories value "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", but goes on to say that the items "on the right" such as "processes and tools" do have value.  

Your instructor has reiterated that by pointing out that all of the Agile "processes and tools" are a means to an end; doing them may help you get to the goals of having a productive, harmonious team that delivers quality software while taking delight in its work.  Using the tool doesn't guarantee the result, but it can help.

In this exercise, we'll try to identify the links between processes and tools and a few of the twelve principles.

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Read principle 1.  What is the connection between this principle, and the process/tools known as "user story mapping" and "minimum viable product".

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Read principle 6.   What is the connection between this principle, and the process/tool known as the "Agile Standup"?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Read principle 12.   What is the connection between this principle, and the process/tool known as the "Retrospective"?

</li>



</ol>

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" markdown="1"> The Agile Manifesto states:

<blockquote markdown="1">
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
</blockquote>


<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">
(15 pts) Tell a (very) short story (it could be something that really happened, or you can just make it up) where  a
  team does the opposite of the fourth of the four values of Agile manifesto, i.e. it values following a plan over responding to change.  If it's a real story, change the names to protect folks' privacy, but use some actual names in your story, e.g. Alice, Bob, Carol, David.  Tell enough of the story that we can see the impact of the team's choice to value following a plan over responding to change.

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">
(15 pts) Now tell the story again, but this time explain how it might have turned out differently if the team chose to value responding to change over following a plan.
</li>


</ol>

</li>


<li style="margin-bottom:1em;" > The 12 principles were originally designed for real-world software development teams, i.e. teams of individuals that are generally full-time employees, dedicated full-time, while at work, to software development.  Some of the principles have to be modified to be applicable in an academic course, even if that academic course is attempting to mirror real world practice.  Principles 4 and 5 may be particularly in need of adaptation.
    
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Choose either principle 4 or 5 and write a new version of it that, as far as you can tell, captures that same intent or spirit as the original, but is more appropriate for CS48 team. (see the next question too, before you start your answer).
</li> 

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain what changes you made from the original principle 4 or 5, and why you made those changes.  (For full credit, your explanation should be rooted in the differences, to the best of your knowledge, between real world working conditions and those that apply in a CS48 team.)

</li> 

</ol>
  
  
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;" > (10 pts) Principles 9, 10 and 11 have to do with design.  Reflect on the software product that your specific project team is working on, and some of the design challenges you face.   Choose one of the three principles (9, 10, 11) and explain how you think your team could apply it to produce a better outcome.
  
</li>
